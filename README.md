## About

An English and Chinese flashcard generator which automatically fetches images from Pexels (free image service) to create flashcards.
At the moment, the English words and Chinese words are filled via json, because I need to find a free translation service.
The app then maps over the english words to find the Pexels image to generate each flashcard
In the future, users will only need to enter the english words and the app will fetch the image and the translation automatically
